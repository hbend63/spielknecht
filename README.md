Simulation Game Software 
It is developed for the Game PRESTO (Vollmer/Scheffcyk). But you might use it for other purposes.

The RFID-Reader is built from an ESP32 Dev2- Board and the reader RFID-RC522.

The Connectionpins are:

RFID-RC522	ESP32
	SDA ->	G5
	SCK	->	G18
	MOSI->	G23
	MISO->	G19
	IRQ	->	
	GND	->	GND
	RST	->	G27
	3.3V->	3V3
	
The Game is built with QT-Creator in C++. You can use this code feely. If you have improvements, plase let me know.
